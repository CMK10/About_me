### Chemical Kinetics of Biofuel Combustion
[Publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016236122020634?via%3Dihub)

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  During my doctoral research, conducted at the University of Lille within the Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Combustion Processes and the Atmosphere (PC2A - UMR 8522), I delved into the intricate realm of biofuels, compounds derived from lignocellulosic biomass (LDC), and their potential to rapidly decarbonize the transportation sector. My project was co-funded by the ADEME (French Agency for Ecological Transition) and the Hauts-de- France region. The primary objective of my research was to evaluate the economic and technical aspects of the production and application of renewable biofuels in the current transport industry. This journey led to the establishment of a benchmark for potential novel biofuels and/or additives destined for use in gasoline engines, substantiated by a profound understanding of their combustion kinetics and co- oxidation with conventional fuels.

  In 2019, around 30% of CO2 emissions in the EU were attributed to the transportation sector, demanding urgent environmental mitigation measures. While electrification stands out as a viable solution, its extensive adoption faces significant challenges, including budget constraints and the prolonged process of replacing over 300 million internal combustion engine-powered cars. Particularly in segments like aviation and maritime transport, electrification encounters obstacles due to battery density limitations and the lack of sufficiently decarbonized energy sources. Acknowledging these challenges, my thesis was motivated by the potential of renewable biofuels to rapidly decarbonize the transport sector. Derived from lignocellulosic biomass, a non-edible and renewable feedstock, that can be produced in marginal lands. These are non-profitable or less productive areas for traditional crop cultivation due to poor soil quality but may find utility for alternative uses such as bioenergy production, helping strike a balance between biomass cultivation and food security considerations. Biofuels present distinct combustion characteristics, requiring in-depth investigation, before its introduction to the market. The application of these novel biofuels may necessitate the modification of engine operating maps to address issues like knocking in spark-ignition engines, crucial for enhancing thermal efficiency, specially of highly turbocharged engines. Given that knocking and the autoignition of unburned gases at lower temperatures are governed by fuel auto-ignition chemistry, it is imperative to ensure their compatibility with new engines by examining their reaction pathways under "engine" conditions.
  
  In order to investigate autoignition under these conditions, I measured the ignition delay times (IDTs) of mixtures containing isooctane/LDC/O2/inert using the ULille Rapid Compression Machine (RCM) under stoichiometric fuel-air conditions. This machine is a cylindrical reactor equipped with a compressor piston that simulates a spark-ignition engine. IDTs are determined from the experimental pressure profiles and are defined as the time necessary to reach autoignition at a given temperature and pressure. Hence, the shorter the IDT of a given fuel is, the more reactive it is. In the current work, the autoignition time is considered as the time corresponding to the overall maximum of the pressure derivative inside the combustion chamber. In the case where the autoignition takes place in two stages, the cool flame delay (or first-stage ignition delay time - FSIDT) is defined as the time between the Top Dead Center (TDC) and the first maximum of the pressure derivative. The end of this first-stage and transition to the second stage is in turn correlated to the Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC - Negative Temperature Coefficient). The presence of the NTC region and its characteristics are relevant criteria for the evaluation of fuel viability, since properties such as octane numbers and, consequently, fuel octane sensitivity are related to this NTC behavior. In fact, fuels that do not exhibit NTC behavior are the most promising for working with high compression ratio, turbocharged engines, as they lead to a reduction of the incidence of autoignition and detonation during combustion processes.

My investigation focused on three key parameters influencing IDTs: mixture composition, compressed pressure, and the adiabatic core temperature. Specifically, the blending effect of LDC was explored by varying its concentration in the surrogate, a simplified mixture used to allow the understanding of co- oxidation with conventional fuels such as gasoline. The composition effect was investigated by varying the amount of LDC within isooctane mixtures and by varying the compression pressure from 14 to 25 bar. The effect of temperature on the IDT was investigated at 20 bar, and core gas temperatures ranging from 665 to 870 K. The surrogates were formulated at stoichiometric conditions and prepared until the LDC fraction reached the maximum reasonable value given their volatility. The experimental setup also allowed for physical sampling during ignition delay, contributing to detailed kinetic model validation. The chemical analysis of sampled products was conducted using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and thermal conductivity (TCD) / flame ionization (FID) detectors. A hierarchical methodology was employed to develop a kinetic mechanism, combining a detailed model for isooctane from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) with a sub-mechanism for anisole, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of ignition delay in biofuel surrogates. For prenol, the Co-optima model, developed by LLNL, was used to simulate the autoignition phenomena. A summary outline of the process used for the development and validation of kinetic models is presented below.

Even though the blending ratios are different for each mixture, the image bellow shows that the 50/50 isooctane/prenol mixtures are the only blends which show no NTC behavior. It is also interesting that this mixture has the longest ignition delay times in the region from 675 to 787 K, i.e., at low temperature and the shortest ignition delay times at high temperatures in the region from 787 to 852 K. This result suggests that the prenol is a good candidate to formulate gasoline-like biofuels considering that in the modern spark ignition engines a high-octane sensitivity is required. On the other hand, while not suppressing first-stage ignition events, cyclopentanone demonstrates great potential in increasing the ignition delays at all temperatures.

</b></p>

For the modeling results it is observed that the current isooctane model seems to overestimate the conversion of isooctane during the first-stage, while the one of anisole is captured accuratelyThis shows the good performance of the model in capturing both the first-stage and total ignition delay in these conditions. The overestimated conversion of isooctane can however be correlated to the too high reactivity of the model in the intermediate temperature region. For the prenol model, it overestimates the reactivity of the isooctane/prenol (50/50)/O2/inert mixture, for all temperature range. The ignition phenomenology is, therefore, maintained, i.e., with no presence of NTC region. These results showed a constant underprediction of the IDTs of isooctane/prenol mixture of about a factor of two. These are encouraging results, but further modeling work should aim at reducing the global reactivity for these mixtures.

My doctoral journey allowed me to address the potential of several advanced biofuels for incorporation into commercial gasolines through an extensive study of the mechanisms responsible for auto-ignition in co-oxidation conditions. Anisole, o-cresol, prenol, and cyclopentanone were selected as biofuels of interest after an exhaustive literature study of their physico-chemical properties as well as their means of production. This experience has also equipped me with a multifaceted skill set, combining technical proficiency in Python modeling, theoretical insights into the kinetic chemistry of lignocellulosic-derived components, and an understanding of the economic dimensions of biofuel development. The collaboration with ADEME underscores the real-world relevance of this research, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in addressing contemporary challenges in the field of sustainable energy.

### Soot Formation in Ethylene and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG)
[Publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326207094_Estudo_Experimental_da_Formacao_de_Fuligem_em_Chamas_Laminares_de_Hidrocarbonetos_e_Ar)

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    In this research project, funded by the CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development), institution affiliated with the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation, I investigated the mechanisms of soot formation in hydrocarbon flames to address the environmental and health impacts of combustion-generated particulates. Collaboratively, I contributed to the design and construction of a specialized experimental setup using a Gülder burner for non-premixed flames of ethylene and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG). This setup enabled the quantification of soot volumetric fractions using laser diagnostic techniques. Additionally, I utilized MATLAB for image data post-treatment, visualization and interpretation of experimental results. The study revealed complex relationships between fuel flow rates, flame positions, and soot production, with higher flow rates significantly increasing soot formation. These findings were validated against existing literature and provided valuable insights into the processes of pyrolysis, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) formation, and particle aggregation in soot development. This work not only enhanced my expertise in combustion thermodynamics, optical diagnostics, and computational analysis but also highlighted the importance of mitigating the environmental impacts of soot to promote cleaner and more sustainable combustion practices. The results of this research were published as part of my chemical engineering final project.

### Stabilization of Turbulent Methane Flames
[Publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323209516_Experimental_Study_of_a_Lean_Premixed_Turbulent_Swirling_Flame_Stabilization)

Within collaborative research projects, I actively engaged in the international project conducted at the Combustion and Turbulence Laboratory of PUC-Rio, Brazil, with Engineer Philippe Scouflaire and Prof. Nasser Darabiha from the EM2C Laboratory, CNRS - UPR 288, CentraleSupélec, Université Paris- Saclay, France. The main objective of the project was the experimental characterization of the stabilization of premixed and swirled turbulent flames, a crucial aspect of turbulent combustion technologies in lean mixtures. This work aimed to contribute to the development of cleaner and more efficient combustion technologies, particularly for gas turbines and industrial burners.
Premixed turbulent combustion technologies often involve swirl-stabilized combustion, presenting fundamental challenges in predicting the burner blow-off limits adequately. Among the factors influencing swirled turbulent flame and burner behavior, the geometric characteristics of the swirl device and the combustion chamber are crucial. In this study, my goal was to experimentally characterize the geometry of the swirl device and the influence of the combustion chamber confinement on blow-off characteristics, as well as the topologies of premixed turbulent methane-air flames stabilized by the swirl effect. A new experimental bench, depicted in the figure below, was designed, enabling easy modification of the radial geometric characteristics of the swirl device and the confinement of the combustion chamber.

<p align="center"><b>Configurations of swirl device (left) and assembly of burner, swirl device, cooling plate, and confinement (right) (adapted from Figueira da Silva et al., 24th ABCM, 2017).</b></p>

Time-integrated, pan-spectral chemiluminescence images of the combustion process were captured using a Canon EOS Rebel TS camera. Equipped with a 58mm diameter lens without filters, representative images were obtained at different flow rates and equivalence ratios. A LaVision Imager Intense CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) camera, fitted with a 430nm filter, was used to record flame images with a 1-second exposure time and an f-4 aperture. These chemiluminescence images are associated with the CH* radical, representing the heat release zone of premixed flames. To highlight this region, the images were deconvoluted using an Abel inversion technique employing a Fourier- transform-based algorithm. This inversion transforms line-of-sight images into a cross-sectional representation assuming axial symmetry.
For unconfined flames, two types of topologies, V-shaped and M-shaped, were observed depending on the premixing rate. The influence of confinement on flame topology was assessed based on raw chemiluminescence images obtained at 430nm, as well as Abel-deconvoluted images at 430nm, both with identical mixture flow rates and compositions. It was observed that the unconfined flame clearly adopts a V-shape. In contrast, the confined flame is primarily located near the combustion chamber wall.
The study of blow-off limits identified the crucial role played by the confinement area ratio and, to a lesser extent, the influence of swirl geometry. Smaller area ratios led to a significant decrease in the blow-off equivalence ratio for a given mixture flow rate. In particular, it was found that the methane volumetric fraction at blow-off was as low as 4.5%, representing a substantial expansion of the burner's operational envelope. These results are presented in the following image.

The experimental protocol described here can also be modified to study other phenomena or conditions, allowing for a deeper understanding of turbulent combustion processes and expanding the applicability of this setup to other areas of combustion technology research and development.

### Development of Lubricants and Bioproducts 

During my industrial internship at Petrobras, my primary contribution focused on the development of high-performance lubricants for the automotive sector, as well as for aviation, maritime, and industrial applications. My role encompassed the formulation and in-depth characterization of these lubricants through rheological analyses, aiming to ensure optimal performance under diverse conditions.

Lubricants can be formulated solely with base oils (mineral, vegetable, and/or synthetic) or with additives. Additives are essential to guarantee specific properties and excellent performance, with recommended addition percentages ranging from 0.25% to 28% by volume. Its addition to base oils offers advantages in properties such as dispersancy, detergency, antioxidant, corrosion prevention, anti- foam, viscosity modification, emulsion, adhesion, etc. Mineral base oils, derived from petroleum, depend on the refining process, and significantly influence the characteristics of lubricants as their main components. They can be obtained through treatments such as atmospheric distillation, vacuum distillation, or solvent extraction.

Concerning automotive lubricants, my work focused on the formulation of high-performance competition lubricants. In 2014, Petrobras collaborated with the Williams F1 Team, providing fuel and lubricants produced at Cenpes (Petrobras Research Center). This allowed me to develop a thorough understanding of the composition of lubricating oils and their specific applications in high-quality demanding environments such as Formula 1.

Simultaneously, motivated by growing environmental concerns related to the negative impacts of lubricants on our ecosystem, I actively participated in the development of biolubricants. These are designed to mitigate the harmful environmental consequences, offering environmentally friendly solutions. Derived from vegetable oils, they are characterized by a composition incorporating natural or modified oils, exhibiting high biodegradability and low eco-toxicity. In a broader context, it is crucial to highlight the challenges posed by conventional lubricants. It is estimated that over half of these lubricants, used globally, end up in the environment, through evaporation or accidental spills. Alarmingly, most of this volume consists of non-degradable mineral or synthetic oils. Thus, in the context of my commitment to sustainable development, I focused my efforts on the development of biolubricants derived from soybean, sunflower, babassu, cotton, and carnauba, with a particular emphasis on those derived from castor oil. Thanks to their high viscosity, these biolubricants have proven particularly beneficial for ship engines and hydroelectric plant equipment, providing environmentally friendly solutions, and contributing to the reduction of environmental impacts.

I also conducted a variety of laboratory tests, adhering to regulatory standards associated with lubricant production and the petroleum industry. These tests included the measurement of viscosity, viscosity index (VI), flash point, determination of water content by distillation, water and sediment separation by centrifugation, total acid number (TAN and TBN), as well as other analyses such as demulsibility, dilution, grease consistency, and dropping point. These methods were carried out in accordance with industry standards such as ISO/TC 28, ISO 3448, SAE J300, and ASTM D93, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the obtained results.

This internship enriched my understanding of the formulation and quality control processes of lubricants and biolubricants, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive perspective that integrates the economic and environmental dimensions of their production and application. My immersion in the regulatory standards of the petroleum industry, along with the understanding of the terminology related to petroleum products, chemical handling, and disposal procedures, helped me to strengthen my engineering and scientific knowledge. Moreover, this experience provided me with a privileged perspective on the progress of the industrial research and development in lubricants, shedding light on the complexities of the patenting process and the dynamics of partnerships between industry and university.

### Organometallic Characterization of Brazilian Oils
[Publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356287489_Determinacao_elementar_via_ICP-MS_em_fracoes_de_oleo_cru) 

Characterization of Brazilian oils, with a particular emphasis on determining the concentrations of nickel (Ni) and vanadium (V) using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) within various fractions of crude oil. The goal was to develop a fractionation and analysis method, providing crucial data for future geochemical and petroleum industry applications. This work was conducted at the LABSPECTRO Atomic Spectrometry Laboratory (PUC-Rio) and co-funded by Petrobras and FAPERJ.

The Ni/V ratio is a geochemical parameter used to study the origin of oil, as well as the effects of maturation and biodegradation during the processes of formation and accumulation. These elements are primarily found in the aromatic and polar fractions of crude oil, in the form of organometallic complexes with tetrapyrrolic nuclei, known as porphyrins, as indicated in the image below. The presence of Ni and V can be considered a "fingerprint" due to the relationship between their concentrations, which is maintained throughout the refining process, thus providing crucial information about its geological origin.

<p align="center"><b>Etioporphyrin present in petroleum. M: VO2+ ou Ni2+ (Mergulhão et al., 36th RASBQ, 2013).</b></p>

During the crude oil fractionation process, I utilized liquid chromatography columns employing specific solvents at each step. Initially, to obtain the first fraction (paraffinic, aromatic, and polar - PAP), I introduced 0.6 ml of diluted crude oil into a gravimetric column filled with activated silica. Then, a solvent mixture was added sequentially, creating a gradient of increasing polarity. When the solution became transparent, the second fraction, resin (asphaltenes), was obtained by introducing a mixture of ultrapure water, methanol, and chloroform, operated until complete evaporation. The collected fractions were evaporated using a rotary evaporator, then again under argon flow, and stored at -5 oC.

The next phase of the fractionation process involved a medium-pressure column filled with activated silica in methanol. The sample was diluted in toluene and injected via a peristaltic pump, followed by solvent injections according to a decreasing polarity gradient: methanol, methanol and toluene, followed by pure toluene. The system, including a UV-Vis spectroscopy detector coupled with a multimeter to monitor the solution's voltage, indicated the moment of fraction cutting. The fractions were obtained in the following order, according to the decreasing polarity gradient of the solvent: paraffin, FR1 (heavy polar), FR2 (heavy aromatic, polar), FR3 (aromatics). The masses of the fractions were determined and stored at -20 oC. The subsequent decomposition of the fractions in a microwave oven was performed to ensure complete decomposition. All samples were decomposed twice to ensure reproducibility. After decomposition, the samples were diluted in water and subjected to ICP-MS analysis. Mass balance calculations showed a preconcentration of Ni and V in FR1 and FR2, confirmed by their respective concentrations compared to reference samples.

Overall, the innovative approach to organometallic characterization of Brazilian oils offers promising perspectives for a better geochemical understanding. This fractionation and analysis methodology has illuminated the precise distribution of elements, establishing a solid foundation for future studies. The results enhance our understanding of the complex composition of Brazilian oils, opening significant prospects in petroleum geochemistry. This systematic approach can be extrapolated to explore other aspects of petroleum geochemistry, with potential applications extending to the petroleum industry and geochemical research.
